*** ONTOLOGY EVOLUTION ***

Ontologies has become the semantic backbone of knowledge-centric application in many application domains. On of the relevant research problems in this area is how to accommodate for a change in the ontology, once new ontological knowledge occurs that need to be integrated. This problem was extensively studied by the Chinese partner (TODO add cites). One approach to ontology evolution is to determine which of the ontological knowledge is relevant in the new version and to keep this knowledge and discard the other. This is related to the problem of forgetting. A drawback of this approach is that an older knowledge may become relevant again in the future, or one may wish to retrieve historical information from the ontology, which may not be possible once part of the old knowledge was discarded. Therefore we would like to try a different approach by keeping track of the relevance of different pieces of knowledge by explicitly representing relevant metainformation. We will then use the metainformation in reasoning and querying, which will enable to use the only most recent version of the ontology, or any historical version, but also to reason about the change (e.g., why some answer is no longer true, since which version certain knowledge holds, etc.). Here we want to reuse the experience of the Slovak partner with contextual reasoning (Homola et al. 2010, Serafini & Homola 2012, ), metamodelling (Homola et al. 2014, Kubincová et al. 2015) and ontological background models (Svátek et al. 2013) which can all be used to represent and evaluate relevant metainformation in different ways.


*** ABDUCTION ***
ABox Abduction has been investigated in DL ontologies. However, several issues are still unsolved. First, the current form of ABox abduction can only ‘add’ ABox assertions to the original KB but cannot delete incorrect ABox assertions. To resolve this issue, we will define a notion of generalised abduction by allowing negative observation as well as positive observation. Second, a major challenge to ABox abduction is how to efficiently find out all minimal explanations. We will first define suitable concepts of minimal explanations since the standard set-inclusion minimality does not work here. In general, the number of minimal explanations may be infinite. So, we will identify useful conditions under which the number of minimal explanations is finite. From our experiences with ABox abduction, the number of minimal explanations can still be too large to find out them in a short time. We can adapt the approach given in [Du et al 2014] by considering the notion of representative explanations here.

More on a practical side, to evaluate the newly proposed abduction methods we would compare them with practical use cases from the area of medical diagnosis and evaluation of user's condition in the ambient assistant living scenarios. Here we will build on the past experience of the Slovak partner (e.g., Homola & Patkos 2014, Lehocki et al. 2014a-b, Pukancová & Homola 2015).
