*** SK INSTITUTION ***

Comenius University in Bratislava is the largest university in Slovakia. Based in Bratislava, it has 13 faculties and about 21,000 students. It is also an important center of research in a number of scientific areas including natural science, humanities, and social sciences, law, and medicine. The Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics is a leading research faculty in Slovakia in its respective areas. Its research teams played a major role in establishment of research but as well education in computer science, artificial intelligence and knowledge representation in Slovakia among other fields.

The team on the Slovak side consists of three researchers and one PhD student who are part of the Knowledge Representation research group. 
The focus of the group in the past has been on various aspects of knowledge representations, including logic programming, belief revision and update, description logics and ontologies, linked open data vocabularies, contextual aspects of knowledge, distributed and heterogeneous knowledge sources. 
Our group was part of a number of national projects awarded by Slovak research agencies VEGA and APVV. The team members have also participated in a number of bilateral proposals with foreign institutes.

Martin Homola is an assistant professor at DAI FMFI UK. His research interests include knowledge representation, ontologies, distributed and contextual reasoning.  He was also involved with more applied research involving knowledge architecture for telemedical systems. He earned his PhD from Comenius University in 2010. He worked as a postdoc in FBK, Trento, Italy, under supervision of Luciano Serafini, one of the leading researchers in contextualized knowledge representation. During his stay in Trento he was involved in research on contextualized representation for Semantic Web data. He co-authored 4 journal articles, 3 invited book chapters, and over 30 peer-reviewed papers published on international workshops and conferences. Since 2012 he is a co-chair of the International Workshop on Acquisition, Representation and Reasoning about Context with Logic (ARCOE-Logic) and has served in the PC of conferences and workshops such as SOFSEM, KESW, Znalosti, and WIKT. He served as reviewer for Web Semantics; Knowledge-Based Systems; and Applied Ontology journals. He has been involved in multiple national and bilateral projects. He is also active in pedagogical practice, teaching courses on computational logic, knowledge representation, and web technology. He has supervised more than 10 master students and a number of bachelor students.

Ján Kľuka is an assistant professor at DAI FMFI UK. He earned his PhD in computer science in 2010. He authored or co-authored 10 papers presented at international conferences and workshops. His professional interests include description logics and ontologies, declarative programming, first- and second-order logic and arithmetic, program correctness, descriptive complexity, methods of automated deduction, and web technologies. He co-developed the programming language CL with a semi-automated theorem prover and a web-based interface.

Júlia Pukancová is a PhD student at DAI FMFI UK, where she received Master's degree in 2014. Her recent interest is knowledge architecture and reasoning services for telemedical data, in particular analytical and diagnostic reasoning on top of ontologies.  She has already co-authored one workshop paper.


*** UNIQUE RESOURCES ***

The Slovak team has strong theoretical background in knowledge representation. Particularly in relation to the project, Martin Homola has co-authored a number of papers in the area of contextual knowledge representation, and together with Ján Kľuka they recently focused on metamodelling with description logics. This expertise is relevant to the project goals and it is unique to the Slovak side.

Apart from the theoretical know-how, the Slovak team has an ongoing collaboration with National Center for Telemedicine Services in Slovakia. Within this collaboration we focus on practical application of knowledge-based inference methods and tools, including ontologies and diagnostic reasoning within telemedical and remote health care scenarios. This brings real-world use-cases that we can use for evaluation of the proposed new techniques with the project.

Or group is also well established in relations with a number or research centers in Europe: we have recently collaborated with the NOVA Laboratory for Computer Science and Informatics, New University of Lisbon, Portugal (Joao Leite), Economical University of Prague, Czech Republic (Vojtěch Svátek), Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion Crete (Giorgos Flouris), and Vienna Technical University (Stefan Woltran). These contacts may be useful during the proposed project in that we may approach an external expert to consult on selected topics and extend the collaboration also to other research centers.
