Martin Homola is an assistant professor at DAI FMFI UK. His research interests include knowledge representation, ontologies, distributed and contextual reasoning.  He was also involved with more applied research involving knowledge architecture for telemedical systems. He earned his PhD from Comenius University in 2010. He worked as a postdoc in FBK, Trento, Italy, under supervision of Luciano Serafini, one of the leading researchers in contextualized knowledge representation. During his stay in Trento he was involved in research on contextualized representation for Semantic Web data. He co-authored 4 journal articles, 3 invited book chapters, and over 30 peer-reviewed papers published on international workshops and conferences. Since 2012 he is a co-chair of the International Workshop on Acquisition, Representation and Reasoning about Context with Logic (ARCOE-Logic) and has served in the PC of conferences and workshops such as SOFSEM, KESW, Znalosti, and WIKT. He served as reviewer for Web Semantics; Knowledge-Based Systems; and Applied Ontology journals. He has been involved in multiple national and bilateral projects. He is also active in pedagogical practice, teaching courses on computational logic, knowledge representation, and web technology. He has supervised more than 10 master students and a number of bachelor students.

Ján Kľuka is an assistant professor at DAI FMFI UK. He earned his PhD in computer science in 2010. He authored or co-authored 10 papers presented at international conferences and workshops. His professional interests include description logics and ontologies, declarative programming, first- and second-order logic and arithmetic, program correctness, descriptive complexity, methods of automated deduction, and web technologies. He co-developed the programming language CL with a semi-automated theorem prover and a web-based interface.

Júlia Pukancová is a PhD student at DAI FMFI UK, where she received Master's degree in 2014. Her recent interest is knowledge architecture and reasoning services for telemedical data, in particular analytical and diagnostic reasoning on top of ontologies.  She has already co-authored one workshop paper.
