RESEARCH AIM TARGETS, ORIGINALITY AND TOPICALITY OF THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE (MAX. 15 000 CHARACTERS):

*** State of the art ***

Under the frame of the Semantic Web and Linked Data initiatives, large volumes of semantic data are now being published on the Web. This includes datasets such as DBPedia (which now contains over 100 million data triples), but also many other data sets, e.g., those published under the open government initiatives by US government or other governments in the EU.

Such data sources are built with technologies crafted for the Semantics Web (SW), they are commonly represented using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) (Beckett, 2004) and it is aligned with semantic vocabularies (ontologies) commonly represented in OWL (W3C, 2012) whose semantic basis is derived from description logics (DL) (Baader et al., 2003).

Currently the Linked Data cloud already shares a number of characteristics with big data, as the volumes of semantic data being posted are very large, and some of this data is also very dynamic and frequently updated (such as various data fed from weather or traffic information sensors, etc.) Thus, the process of large-scale semantic data archiving, and semantic evolution of data is now a highly relevant research area in knowledge management.

Early approaches to semantic data archiving focus predominantly on the problem of version management and finding differences between different versions of the data. More recent research focuses also on the questions of effective querying and combining of data from different versions. The works in this direction were developed by Axel Polleres, Liliana Stojanovic, Grigoris Anotiou, but also the Chinese partner in this project, Guilin Qi has done substantial contribution in this area. The main limitations of these approaches is either in expressive power of the query language, but also with scalability, in particular to the extent of efficient reasoning support for ontology evolution with millions of RDF triples. [TODO check from Guilin + Add some cites]

However, the evolution of knowledge in Linked Data brings also more complex use cases. Some resources may be combined, merged or remodelled due to enabling their reuse in new applications. The changes between versions should be characterized logically which would enable to pose expressive queries about them.

Different knowledge resources are often modelled with different assumed context. Older proposals to handle the context on the Semantic Web include Named Graphs (Carroll et al. 2005); more research was developed in this direction and also the Slovak partner has collaborated on this topic (Homola et al. 2010, Serafini & Homola 2012). It is well known that a characterization of the change in the context between two knowledge resources may have an important influence of how the knowledge from one resource may be combined with another (Benerecetti et al. 2000). To our best knowledge, this problem was not yet applied in the area of evolution of Semantic Web or Linked Data knowledge resources where the characterization of the shift in context between two versions of the resource may be also very relevant.

Another relevant problem in this respect, which is frequent between linked data reousces due to expressive limitations of the semantic languages used in linked data, such as RDF and OWL
is the problem of semantic heterogenity. For example, it sometimes happens that clases or property relations may be represented as objects in some particular resources. Since the reasons for this practice  is justified, such chnagnes (which are very hard to align in reasoning) may be introduced also between two versions of one evolving resource. The Slovak partner has participated in prelimiary explorations of this topic (e.g. Svátek et al. 2013), however, further research applied in the area of linked data evolution and archiving is not known to us.

Another approach that may be useful to reason about archived versions of Linked Data sources is metamodelling (i.e., when constructs from knowledge bases, such as classes, properties, or even statements are treated as elementary objects and are classified into metaclasses, modelled, and reasoned with). RDF already has limited support for metamodelling as its semantics is higher-order and it allows reification of statements (Hayes & Patel-Schneider 2014). Further proposals recently appeared with the aim to provide support for metamodelling with ontologies based on DL (Motik 2007) and OWL (Glimm et al. 2010). Researchers of the Slovak partners have also done some work in this area (Homola et al. 2014, Kubincová et al. 2015). Recenly studies exploitating of metamodelling in expressive querying occured (De Giacomo et al. 2011, Bischof et al. 2015) and we believe that this approach (also called meta-querying) may be useful in improving the query expressivity over evolving linked data resources.

The main focus of cooperation in this project will be on evolution of large-scale semantic data resources, where we would concentrate on improving the expressive power of version-based queries by applying the techniques from the areas of contextual knowledge representation and metamodelling, but in addition we will also focus on the effectivity of querying and reasoning algorithms for large scale evolution of semantic data.

*** Motivation and objectives ***

   Objective 1: To investigate the types of contextual meta information (including time, but also other contextual dimensions) that is relevant to the problem of combining and reasoning with different versions of LOD sources, together with suitable representational languages and reasoning algorithms.

   Objective 2: To investigate knowledge heterogeneity that may be introduced between the versions of LOD data sources (e.g., one may choose to reify a property in the next version). And to find ways for recognition and treatment of these heterogeneities when combining multiple versions of an evolving data resource in reasoning.

   Objective 3: Investigating on specific query languages aimed at capturing the required expressiveness for RDF versions, enabling reasoning and querying evolution patterns, while identifying restricted fragments to maintain scalability.

   Objective 4: To develop efficient algorithms by balancing syntactic and semantic approaches to ontology evolving. Especially, we will investigate applications of graph databases in KB evolving.

PROJECT SCHEDULE AND ACTIVITIES WITH REGARD TO THE CALL (MAX. 6 000 CHARACTERS)

The project activities will be split into two work packages:

* WP1 (approx. Jan 2016-Mar 2017): Foundations of reasoning and querying of evolving data. In this work package we will focus on the theoretical foundations of ontology evolution and reasoning with/querying over evolving data and we will study (a) the contextual aspects of evolving Linked Data sources, (b) we will focus on metamodelling and how some aspects of evolving data may be captured by it, and (c) we will study the algorithmic side of reasoning and querying over evolving data from the theoretical point of view (complexity, effectiveness, optimization). We expect to propose improvements on the theoretical level and we expect that the first results will be published by the end of 2016 or early 2017.

* WP2 (approx. Nov 2016-Dec 2017): Implementation and evaluation. In this work package we expect to build on the results from WP1 and work towards practical implementation of the most viable results. Towards this end we will rely on the existing ontology evolution infrastructure that is currently developed by the Chinese partner, which we will use as a base. However, we expect that results from WP1 will initiate substantial improvements in the implementation that will lead to improved reasoning capabilities and query expressivity, together with some optimization and overall boost in effectiveness. In the second half of WP2 we will also conduct empirical evaluation on suitable evolving datasets (e.g., obtained from the consecutive snapshots of DBPedia that are freely available). We expect first results to be published in the second half of 2017.

The half-a-year overlap between WP1 and WP2 will enable to start the work on the implementation as soon as first relevant theoretical results are achieved. 

In the second part of 2017 we also plan to work on a major summary publication communicating the overall results of the project.

*** Visits Plan ***

The team is composed of three researchers on each side. We estimate that this will allow us to execute one visit per year on each side where the whole team from the other side will be part of the visit. The preliminary plan of visits:

* First half of 2016: the Chinese team will visit the Slovak partner in Bratislava (approx. 5-7 days) - opening workshop, working meetings
* Second half of 2016: the Slovak team will visit the Chinese partner in Nanjing (approx. 5-7 days) - working meetings
* First half of 2017: the Chinese team will visit the Slovak partner in Bratislava (approx. 5-7 days) - working meetings
* Second half of 2017: the Slovak team will visit the Chinese partner in Nanjing (approx. 5-7 days) - closing workshop, publication activity


IMPORTANCE AND MEANINGFULNESS OF BILATERAL COOPERATION AT INTERNATIONAL PROJECT PARTICIPATION (MAX. 6 000 CHARACTERS)

*** Benefits of the Collaboration ***

The collaboration may generate added value on the Slovak side in terms of new joint research results and publications, experience and know how transfer in a highly relevant research area (see below). The joint project is justified by the fact that the expertise of both teams is complementary. The Chinese side brings expertise from the area of ontology evolution, and in addition a more practical research experience with a number of systems implemented and evaluated in the past, while the Slovak side brings the expertise more on the theoretical and foundational side in the respective areas of contextual knowledge representation, metamodelling and dealing with knowledge heterogeneity. The combined effort will bring different points of view, and may result in novel solutions and contribution w.r.t. the objectives of the project which would otherwise not be achieved.

THE ANTICIPATED CONTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH COOPERATION FOR SLOVAKIA (SOCIO-ECONOMIC BENEFITS) (MAX. 6 000 CHARACTERS)

The project pursues relevant research objectives in the area of knowledge representation and particularly LOD. Extending the capabilities of World Wide Web as we know it today, and fostering effective data reuse in end-user but as well B2B applications the socio-economic contribution of LOD is already extensive. We expect particular innovations in archiving, management and reuse of large linked data sources as the outcome of this project which will further increase its socio-economic impacts on the society. Particularly, we expect to contribute to the technology that makes it possible to

● use existing vast linked data resources more efficiently in terms smaller storage and computational costs
● combine and explore various versions of linked data resources to higher degree in terms of the ability to find relevant data and to understand better the changes on it over time and that are result of evolution
● in the future, to manage larger linked data resources than it is currently possible

In addition, the initiation of collaboration with the group of Guilin Qi at Southeast University, who is among the leading researchers in the area of ontology evolution in Asia is of a great value to our research group and to our university. He has published a number of publications connected to the topic of ontology evolution, and he has lead and collaborated in a number of high-profile research projects, national and international. Our collaboration with his group will result in valuable exchange of experience, and transfer of know how. As part of the project we plan to host seminars that will be open also to the students and scientific public which will further extend the outreach of this collaboration. We believe that we will be able to transfer the gained experience also to the students of our faculty (especially those specializing in artificial intelligence).

This collaboration may improve our ties with the international research community and may result in additional added value in form of future international joint research proposals.
